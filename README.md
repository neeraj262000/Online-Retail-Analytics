🚀 Online Retail Analytics Dashboard – Uncovering Consumer Insights! 🛒📈

Excited to share my Tableau dashboard project, built on the Online Retail dataset! This dashboard explores customer purchasing behavior, regional trends, and product-level insights from thousands of transactions — a great dive into the world of data-driven decision-making.
While I must admit, I made a few mistakes, 😅, the learning has been immense — and incredibly rewarding.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Transaction data exploration from the UK-based online retail store
✅ Identified high-value customers using RFM analysis
✅ Visualized country-wise revenue and quantity trends
✅ Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) for preprocessing and cleaning the data
✅ Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to help stakeholders make faster, data-informed decisions

This project sharpened my skills in data wrangling, customer segmentation, and storytelling through visuals. Looking forward to building more and getting better with every iteration. 💪
